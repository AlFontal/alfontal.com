    "text": "Abstract\nThe roles of climate and true seasonal signatures in the epidemiology of emergent pathogens, and that of SARS-CoV-2 in particular, remain poorly understood. With a statistical method designed to detect transitory associations, we show, for COVID-19 cases, strong consistent negative effects of both temperature and absolute humidity at large spatial scales. At finer spatial resolutions, we substantiate these connections during the seasonal rise and fall of COVID-19. Strong disease responses are identified in the first two waves, suggesting clear ranges for temperature and absolute humidity that are similar to those formerly described for seasonal influenza. For COVID-19, in all studied regions and pandemic waves, a process-based model that incorporates a temperature-dependent transmission rate outperforms baseline formulations with no driver or a sinusoidal seasonality. Our results, so far, classify COVID-19 as a seasonal low-temperature infection and suggest an important contribution of the airborne pathway in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, with implications for the control measures we discuss."

    "text": "Abstract\nKawasaki Disease (KD) is a systemic vasculitis that mainly affects children younger than 5 years old. Although KD cases have been registered in over 60 countries across several continents, its incidence is highest in East Asia, particularly in Japan, where the highest annual incidence rate was recorded in 2018: 359 cases per 100 000 children aged 0-4 years [1]. After more than five decades since its discovery, the etiology of KD is yet to be elucidated. Past studies have analyzed the association between KD and diverse environmental factors, with some advances pointing towards a relevant role of the atmospheric transport of a wind-borne agent as trigger of KD [2, 3]. The epidemiological records of KD in Japan show an increasing incidence trend and a marked seasonality, prompting questions about the nature of the drivers of these changes in incidence. In this work, we focus on updated records from Tokyo prefecture (2011-2018) to find an association with specific air source locations and higher incidence seasons."

    "text": "Abstract\nMany theories have been formulated through decades regarding the causes of the mysterious syndrome known as Kawasaki disease (KD). This pediatric self-limited vasculitis has been escaping full characterization since Tomizaku Kawasaki, PhD, identified the disease that was then named after him. In many of the clinical histories, the role of external factors seems already clear, because the appearance of respiratory symptoms is reported to occur a few days before KD symptoms emerge (eg, an abnormal immune response characterized by increased levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines during the acute phase). However, the many attempts to characterize a unique agent have been unsuccessful so far. Whether this is an indication of a multiplicity of agents (ie, multiple-agent disease) or a complex interplay of factors interacting with the immune system of children who are genetically predisposed still remains an open question. However, in this race against time, a study by Hara and colleagues4 takes advantage of the unique epidemiological situation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan to perform a natural experiment that sheds new light on the hidden etiological processes of KD."

In consequence, the need to develop automated methods of analysis for this kind of data is on the rise. A first step towards inferring a protein’s function is to know its subcellular location. In this thesis we explore the capabilities of modern machine learning techniques, and more specifically deep learning models to predict the subcellular location of proteins only using their amino acid sequence as predictor."

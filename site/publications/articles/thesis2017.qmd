## Abstract


The continuously decreasing cost of sequencing genomes is promoting the generation
of vast amounts of sequence data. In consequence, the need to develop automated
methods of analysis for this kind of data is on the rise. A first step towards inferring
a proteinâ€™s function is to know its subcellular location. In this thesis we explore the
capabilities of modern machine learning techniques, and more specifically deep learning models
to predict the subcellular location of proteins only using their amino acid sequence as predictor.
